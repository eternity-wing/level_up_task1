## Clean Code And Design Patterns
As you know design patterns and clean coding are in most cases language independent, and the diffrences are in the implementation. I've found [PHP The Right Way](https://phptherightway.com) quite useful for improving code quality in php and if you are looking for a good implementation and example of design patterns in php you can find them [here](https://github.com/jupeter/clean-code-php).

useful links:
* [Pear Naming Conventions](https://pear.php.net/manual/en/standards.naming.php)
* [PHP Figs](https://www.php-fig.org/)
* [Modern PHP Without a Framework](https://kevinsmith.io/modern-php-without-a-framework)


## Git Hooks
I've provided some hooks for checking code styles and error correction with Composer-git-hooks([Documentation](https://github.com/BrainMaestro/composer-git-hooks)
).

for adding hooks you shoud add your configuration in composer.json, extra field and then run `composer cghooks update`.

## Code Style
I've found these packages useful for code styling:

* [PHP Coding Standards Fixer](https://cs.symfony.com/)
